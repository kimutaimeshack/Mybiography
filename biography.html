    <hr>
  We are located at Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak, the Amboseli National Parks is one of Kenya's most popular parks.
  we like "Amboseli" as it comes from a Maasai word meaning "salty dust", and it is one of the best places in Africa to view large herds of elephants up close.
   Nature lovers can explore five different habitats here ranging from the dried-up bed of Lake Amboseli, wetlands with sulphur springs, the savannah and woodlands.
  They can also visit the local Maasai community who live around the park and experience their authentic culture.
